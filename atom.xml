    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I have learned a lot! We began learning about Java and a lot of the stuff we learned in chapter one is related to math. This made it very easy to learn because I think that Math is my best subject and I LOVE algebra! It was kind of challenging because we had to solve it by order of operations and there were some in which I didn&rsquo;t know which part I had to do first. We also began doing our mood boards which I found lots of fun! I created my board on pinterest which I already had experience doing. The pictures that I selected to have in my board involved fashion, music, nature, quotes and my family! overall this week went well, but We just started working on chapter 2 of our workbook and i&rsquo;m struggling a bit with it .</p>
