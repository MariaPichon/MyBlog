I think that overall I have had a good progress. In order to stay in good standing I plan to keep attending class everyday and ask as many questions as I can whenever i'm confused. <!--more--> I will also try to help my classmates as much as I can because that not only helps them understand the material but it also helps clarify my understanding and solidify my knowledge.

This week was tough. I feel like we are getting a lot of projects and not enough time, which stresses me because once I get home it should be time to relax because we already spent 9 hours in class but instead we have to use the time to keep studying in order to finish all the assignments we are asssigned in time. That's why I was glad when we were announced that chapter 4 won't be due until next week because it lessens the load a bit and gives me a little more time to finish everything else.

I have also been learning a lot! about css which I'm hoping I will be able to implement into the coding of the upcoming projects and practice a little more.
