This week has gone well! My Portfolio website is starting to look good. I have managed to get the layout that I wanted this whole time and added a pdf of my resume incase anyone wants to download it. <!--more-->Although I'm liking it I still feel like it's too simple and is missing something but I don't know what to add to it or What to do with it. I also got a slideshow that I want to use for my projects working but I don't know how to add it to my portfolio so hopefully I get that working! I have learned a lot! and have also experienced what I could be doing if I get an internship/job related to this job because two graduates of the last cohort visited us and gave us an example of what they have been doing in their internship with drones! I also learned a lot about what to do in interviews ! Although the mock interviews we had this week were scary they gave me a lot of knowledge and I received great tips on what to do to give a great impression.
