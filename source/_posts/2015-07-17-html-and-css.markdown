This week has been great! I find learning about HTML and CSS a lot easier than JavaScript. I find all the coding behind a webpage/website very interesting. I'm a little confused about when to use JavaScript and HTML but I still have learned alot! I didn't have time to work on chapter 3 but I will be working on it on Monday.
