This week I learned a lot!I have progressed a lot in worksheet 2 but there's still a couple thing that i don't completely understand like loops. I also had lots of fun doing our first workshop. Everyone took it seriously and participated. I learned what a scrum board does and how it works. Overall week 3 was good.
